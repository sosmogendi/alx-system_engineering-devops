This project is designed to help you practice working with the Reddit API using Python. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain how to use the Reddit API, perform pagination, parse JSON data, make recursive API calls, and sort dictionaries by value.

## Background Context

This project focuses on working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API. It will help you gain hands-on experience with API calls, data parsing, and other skills that are valuable for technical interviews and real-world applications. You will practice working with different endpoints and handling data from Reddit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- Use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Ensure all your files are executable.
