# 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing

## Description

This project focuses on learning and practicing various concepts related to shell scripting using Bash. It covers loops, conditions, parsing, and other essential topics in the context of DevOps.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Create SSH keys
- Understand the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
